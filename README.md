Note :-I didn't use library function such as  because the complexity of program is very high specially for large no (>10^8) and using library function will increase it complexity further more.
I tried to solve this problem in three (namely C,java,Python)language and not able to decrease it complexity by bigger factor.
I even use combination algebra to solve this problem and in that case also complexity was very high.
#Thank you
