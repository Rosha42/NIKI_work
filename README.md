#Logic
we can solve above question by two different method one using combinational algebra and one by predicting series.                      
After predicting series we can say that it is making a FIibaonacci series and can solve accordingly.                           
Given code is based upon fibonacci series solution
#Note 
I didn't use library function such as Math.pow etc because the complexity of program is very high specially for large no (>10^8) and using library function will increase it complexity further more.
I tried to solve this problem in three (namely C,java,Python)language and not able to decrease it complexity by bigger factor.
I even use combinational algebra to solve this problem and in that case also complexity was very high.
I would like to hear any suggestion regarding decrease in complexity of this code.
#Thank you
